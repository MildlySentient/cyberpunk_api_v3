    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2024-05-20</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        This application (Cyberpunk 2020 GPT API and Custom GPT) does <strong>not</strong> intentionally collect,
        store, or share any personal information about users. All interactions with the API and GPT are transient and
        are not saved by the backend or the developers.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Processing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Queries sent to the API or GPT are processed in memory to generate a response and are <strong>not logged</strong> or stored.</li>
        <li>Uploaded files (e.g., game data, scenario tables) are used only to generate immediate responses and are not retained.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third Parties</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The backend is hosted on <a href="https://render.com/" target="_blank">Render.com</a> or <a href="https://railway.app/" target="_blank">Railway</a> and subject to their privacy and security policies.</li>
        <li>No analytics, tracking, or advertising services are used.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>
        Reasonable efforts are made to secure the server and codebase, but no system is perfectly secure.
        Do not submit sensitive or personal information through this tool.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This tool is not intended for children under 13. No information is knowingly collected from minors.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>This policy may be updated at any time. Changes will be published to the public GitHub repository or project domain.</p>
